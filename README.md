# 📘 Learning Journey

**Learning Journey** is an offline SwiftUI app that helps users **track their learning goals** and **stay consistent** through a simple, motivating **streak system**.

---

## ✨ Overview

Learning Journey is built to make personal growth measurable — one day at a time.  
Users can log whether they **learned** or **froze** each day, keeping a streak that reflects their learning consistency.

The app works entirely **offline**, making it ideal for focused, distraction-free learning.

## 🧠 Core Features

- 📅 **Daily Logging** — Mark if you’ve learned or taken a freeze day.  
- 🔥 **Streak System** — Keep your learning streak alive and stay motivated.  
- ❄️ **Freeze Option** — Pause progress without losing your streak (limited per goal duration).  
- 🌙 **Offline-First** — No login or internet connection required.  
- 🎨 **Minimal UI** — Simple and focused design focused on usability with dark mode feature.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Create a Goal** (e.g., "Learn Swift for 7 Days").  
2. **Log Your Progress** daily as *Learned* or *Freezed*.  
3. **Track Streaks** — resets if 32 hours pass without logging.  
4. **Stay Motivated** — visualize progress in the calendar and streak summary.

## 🧩 Example Use Case

- Goal: *Learn Swift for 1 Week*  
- You learn for 5 days straight → 🔥 5-day streak  
- You freeze one day → ❄️ still 5-day streak  
- You complete all 7 days → ✅ goal achieved
